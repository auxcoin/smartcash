Getting Started
===============

The SmartCard is a way to hold SMART on a physical card. You don’t need a phone to hold your SMART.
If you have ever had a problem with using a phone inside a building you will get why this is ideal.
Only the merchant needs the internet connection.
As simple to use as a credit or debit card but not controlled by any 3rd party processor.
And not a preloaded card using a visa fiat system…this is real crypto to crypto.

The easiest way to install the SmartCard for Android is from the
Google Play Store.
