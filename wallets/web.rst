`WebWallet <https://wallet.smartcash.cc>`_ is a web interface to the
SmartCash blockchain. It is explicitly not an online wallet,
meaning you maintain control over your private keys at all times. Unlike
many other light wallets, Web Wallet also supports advanced SmartCash
features such as instantpay, voting, smartvault, smartcard, buy or convert.


Web Wallet offers complete and detailed documentation for all functions.
