`WebWallet <https://wallet.smartcash.cc>`_ is a web interface to the
SmartCash blockchain. It is explicitly not an online wallet,
meaning you maintain control over your private keys at all times. Unlike
many other light wallets, WebWallet also supports advanced SmartCash
features such as instantpay, voting, smartvault, smartcard, by or convert.


WebWallet offers complete and detailed documentation for all functions.
