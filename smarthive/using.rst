Using SmartVote
===============

SmartCash SmartHive is voting and funding platform. This documentation introduces and details the
theory and practice to use the system.

Understanding the process
=========================

Introduction
------------

- smarthive consists of three components: Proposals, Votes, and Fund Allocated
- Anyone can submit a proposal for a small fee
- Each valid smartcash holder can vote for, against or abstain on proposals
- Approved proposals become Fund Allocated
- Fund Allocated are paid directly from Project Treasury to the proposal owner

Proposals
---------

- Proposals are a request to receive funds
- Proposals can be submitted by anyone for a fee of 100 SMART. The proposal
  fee is irreversibly destroyed on submission.
- Proposals cannot be altered once submitted

Votes
-----

- Votes are cast using the address that have > 1 smartcash
- Votes can be changed at any time


Proposal structure
------------------

The following information is required to create a proposal:

- proposal-name: a unique label
- Summary: a proposer-created webpage
- Forum Proposal Link: forum post containing detailed proposal information
- block-start: the requested start of proposal payments
- SmartCash Payment Address: the address to receive proposal payments
- Total Cost: the requested payment amount
- And More

Persistence
-----------

1. Proposal Funds can not be transferred back to the community as a kickback, rebate, or donation nor can they be used to fund third parties. Proposals that have this objectives will be removed. 
2. Your proposal will be validated by our team before it goes live. We will check if it does not hurt any of the terms, only after this will be released on the site 
3. Proposals will be open for 14 days. If during the last day of voting, the status change, the proposal will be extended for another 24h 
4. After submitting, you will not be able to edit the proposal 

Templates
---------

The following two Microsoft Word templates are available to help facilitate standardized proposal submission and updates.
Usage is recommended, but not required.
