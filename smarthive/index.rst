SmartHive Teams
---------------

We believe ‘Core’ teams are a bad idea and something that ultimately leads to inefficiency and corruption. We want to move past it and create a decentralized organizational model inspired by ant and bee colonies. 

In order to create and maintain a decentralized governance structure, we are introducing two concepts SmartHive and Hive Structuring Teams (HST). SmartHive enables anyone that holds coins to vote on proposals submitted by the community. SmartHive will be the lifeblood of the project, which will allow anyone to get involved and submit proposals, helping to generate organic growth at a grassroots level, creating a bottom-up management structure.

The Hive Structuring Teams (HST) will lay the groundwork for the project and set the framework for the project’s evolution. Initially, the Hive Structuring Teams will operate three separate departments in charge of vital project areas, such as development, outreach and support. Each of these three departments will end up employing people. As teams grow larger, bigger than eight members, more teams will be created, each with its own budget and team coordinator, operating autonomously without a central command and control structure in place.

The Hive Structuring Teams will consist of people directly involved in the project on a day to day basis, while the overall SmartHive will aim to enrol and engage community members and other 3rd parties interested in growing SmartCash into a global worldwide currency.

Right now we have 6 teams <https://smartcash.cc/hive-teams/>

SmartVote
---------

All Smartcash users deserve a voice, from day #1. That is why Smartcash is pioneering in the crypto-governance space and was built around Smarthive, the platform that lets all users vote on the direction of the project. More information will be released soon describing this platform in depth.

Basically, each SmartCash coin is worth 1 vote, to keep it simple.
