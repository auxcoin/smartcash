Understanding SmartVote
=======================

One of the greatest challenges of building a cryptocurrency platform is
ensuring you create a decentralized system of governance to manage,
fund, maintain and expand the project. This key element has been absent
in every major currency to date, so the natural response is to create a
not-for-profit foundation that is tasked with maintaining the core
protocol and promoting the coin, but is not really connected to the coin
holders in any meaningful way. This approach has a few issues that have
been made evident from the experience of older crypto currency
platforms.

Current crypto foundations are not related to the currency itself by any
mechanism that is included in the protocol and are not designed to
outlive early adopters when they lose interest. The foundation then
struggles to maintain funding until it implodes and core development of
the protocol is left scrambling for funding or depending on charity that
canâ€™t be counted on and does not allow for proper budgeting and
planning. Donations are also unfair to donors because there are always
free riders that benefit from the effort done by others without
contributing. Other projects have financed themselves by premining coins
or running prelaunch sales, which is not a great solution either because
control of the funds is centralized and at that stage it is impossible
to quantify the future needs of the project.

Through the network of full nodes and the collateral requirement, SmartCash
already has a decentralized network of smartnode operators that are
heavily invested in the future of the currency, and that as hive structuring teams can
act as stewards of the core protocol development, outreach, web, quality assurance, support. We
propose a decentralized management system based on the voting mechanism. 

All SmartCash holders can vote on projects to be funded from the community hive budget. There is no cost or fee to vote.

Project treasury and smartvote
==============================

The system works as a decentralized voting mechanism set up in the rules
governing the blockchain, where budgets for specific projects are
proposed, then the SmartCash holders as a whole vote on them. Each project, if it passes, is added to the total budget and paid from the project treasury to the person doing the work.

Reward
======

To guarantee long term sustainability of the blockchain, the network
keeps a portion of the block rewards back as new blocks are created,
with the smartnode operators tasked to act as stewards and invest in
the maintenance and expansion of the network. This results in faster development and promotion, creating a virtuous cycle that benefits all actors, including miners, smartnode operators, investors
and users. More importantly, this gives the blockchain itself a self-preservation mechanism that is beyond the control of any individual.

Contractors and proposals
=========================

Contractors of the blockchain can be developers, outreach professionals,
team leaders, attorneys or even people appointed to do specific tasks.
Proposals generally begin life as simple `pre-proposal forum posts
<https://forum.smartcash.cc/c/smarthive/pre-proposal-discussion/>`_
on the SmartCash Forum, where feedback and suggestions are solicited from the
general community. Once the proposal owner decides they have a reasonable chance of passing their proposal, he created proposal here https://vote.smartcash.cc/. A fee of 100 SmartCash is associated with
this action to prevent spam and ensure only serious proposals make it to this stage. Several tools exist to allow smartcash holder to comfortably review and vote on proposals. 

Proposal websites
=================

The community has gathered around `SmartHive Governance Portal <https://vote.smartcash.cc>`__ as a website to facilitate discussion and voting on proposals.

Conclusion
==========

We envision a future in which this model of transparent, unbreakable and
verifiable contribution to the common good, in combination with
continuous participation of the crowd through active voting, is utilized
to manage organizations that are owned or operated jointly by its
members, who share the benefits and responsibilities of those
collectives, like governments, cooperative corporations, unions, DAOs,
cryptocurrencies, etc. We call this model Community Governance via Blockchain.
