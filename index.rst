SmartCash is a peer-to-peer digital currency that can be used without having to trust a third party, which makes it possible to be your own bank. The name reflects the aim: By focusing on being ease to use even for people who aren‘t crypto geeks, on being merchant friendly and with a self-funded unique governance model SmartCash aims to be the cryptocurrency of everyone’s choice when it comes to payments, SmartCash
currently also offers instant transactions (:ref:`instantpay`) and operates a self-governing and
self-funding model that enables the SmartCash network to pay individuals and
businesses for work that adds value to the network. This
:ref:`smarthive and budgeting system <smarthive>`.

If you are new to cryptocurrencies, the most important change to
understand is that transactions occur directly between two parties
without any central authority to facilitate the transaction. This also
means that you are responsible for your own security - there is no bank
or credit card company to reverse a transaction if your funds are stolen
or lost. In this sense, it is similar to cash or gold, but
cryptocurrency can be spent locally and internationally with equal ease,
if you are confident you are sending funds to the right destination. For
these reasons, the SmartCash documentation has a strong focus on safety and
understanding the concepts and features that drive the SmartCash ecosystem.
