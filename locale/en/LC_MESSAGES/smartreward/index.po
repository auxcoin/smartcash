"In the upcoming 1.3 Phoenix release, one of the major changes will be the"
" introduction of the SuperRewards. SmartRewards has been a way to earn "
"passive income for all SmartCash holders. But now we have added a higher "
"deposit tier that qualifies an address as SuperRewards. The 1.3 release "
"will change block rewards to provide 60% allocation to SmartRewards, "
"helping to effectively distribute incentives to community participants "
"and receive higher rewards."

"The yearly yield will depend on how long the users hold coins at their "
"addresses. The gif below shows how the estimated yearly yield changes "
"depending on the holding period (1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks). "
"Users will be able to get the maximum yearly yield if they hold the coins"
" for 4 weeks or more. Additionally, users will also be able to receive "
"SuperRewards if they have 1 million or more SMART at one address. "
"SuperRewards will have a higher annual yield. The final rate will depend "
"on how many addresses participate and qualify for the reward. It is worth"
" to noticing that this will be significantly higher than the current "
"percentage, since the rewards allocation is increased and only activated "
"non SmartNode addresses are eligible for SmartRewards. The updated "
"SmartRewards will allow to earn passive income every week."
