"SmartRewards are a price stabilization mechanism and a way to encourage "
"long term holding. Long term holders are key to the projectâ€™s success "
"since the SmartHive treasury needs SmartCash to appreciate in value in "
"order to fund meaningful 3rd party proposals and help grow SmartCash into"
" a successful global crypto-currency. Beginning at block 574,100, the "
"current SmartRewards model will change to a Decentralized Distribution. "
"SmartRewards will then be distributed after every 47,500 Blocks to all "
"eligible addresses. The payouts will begin 200 Blocks after the cycle "
"ends and 1000 addresses will be paid every other block. SmartNodes will "
"keep track on which addresses are eligible and which are not. You will "
"earn SmartRewards on any address for which you hold the keys (web or "
"desktop, SmartNode included!) which holds >=1000 SMART for one month and "
"does not make any outgoing transactions during that time. Please note, "
"most exchanges do not pay SmartRewards to their users, holding >= 1000 "
"SMART on an exchange does not guarantee a reward. The SmartRewards will "
"come out of the 15% block reward allocation. - Payment after every 47500 "
"blocks starting at 574100. Typically, around the 25th of each month. - "
"All users need to move funds into addresses holding at least 1000 SMART "
"before the snapshot to be counted. - If you spend ANY amount from an "
"address, it will be ineligible for SmartRewards until the next round."
