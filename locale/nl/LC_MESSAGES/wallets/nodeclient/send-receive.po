"Your SmartCash NodeClient Wallet is associated with a number of unique "

"to the destination address, which is controlled by another SmartCash user"

"transaction, although smartnode and mining payments are only released "

"The other options relate to fees and instantpay. You can choose if you "

"it from the amount sent. You can also increase your fee to encourage "
"nodes on the network to prioritize your transaction. Choosing "
"**instantpay** has a similar effect, but actually relies on a different "
"mechanism in the second layer network to speed up the transaction time."
