"instantpay functions by setting a flag on the transaction, causing "
"deterministic selection of a quorum of 10 smartnodes for each input spent in"
" an instantpay transaction. The smartnodes examine the input, and if a "
"majority determines it has at least six confirmations, they then accept the "
"transaction. The input is then locked until the transaction has been "
"confirmed in six mined blocks, at which point the output can be used as an "
"input in another instantpay transaction. This differs from inputs used in "
"normal transactions, which can be spent after just one confirmation "
"regardless of whether the SmartCash was received using instantpay or not. A "
"higher fee will be charged for instantpay transactions with more than four "
"inputs, according to the :ref:`fee schedule <fees>`. Note that the receiving"
" wallet must also be aware of instantpay in order to be able to immediately "
"continue with the transaction or display an appropriate notification that "
"the transaction should be considered locked. If the receiving wallet is not "
"aware of instantpay, it will simply appear as a normal transaction and you "
"will need to wait for standard block confirmations."
