"In order to create and maintain a decentralized governance structure, we are"
" introducing two concepts SmartHive and Hive Structuring Teams (HST). "
"SmartHive enables anyone that holds coins to vote on proposals submitted by "
"the community. SmartHive will be the lifeblood of the project, which will "
"allow anyone to get involved and submit proposals, helping to generate "
"organic growth at a grassroots level, creating a bottom-up management "
"structure."

"The Hive Structuring Teams (HST) will lay the groundwork for the project and"
" set the framework for the project’s evolution. Initially, the Hive "
"Structuring Teams will operate three separate departments in charge of vital"
" project areas, such as development, outreach and support. Each of these "
"three departments will end up employing people. As teams grow larger, bigger"
" than eight members, more teams will be created, each with its own budget "
"and team coordinator, operating autonomously without a central command and "
"control structure in place."

"The Hive Structuring Teams will consist of people directly involved in the "
"project on a day to day basis, while the overall SmartHive will aim to enrol"
" and engage community members and other 3rd parties interested in growing "
"SmartCash into a global worldwide currency."
