"To run SmartCash Node Client for the first time, either open Launchpad or "

" or **SmartCash-Qt** to start the application. You may see a warning about "
"opening an app from an unidentified developer. To resolve this problem, "
"simply Control-click the app icon and choose **Open** from the shortcut "
"menu, then click **Open** again in the dialog box. The app is saved as an "
"exception to your security settings, and you can open it in the future by "
"double-clicking it just as you can any registered app. The first time the "
"program is launched, you will be offered a choice of where you want to store"
" your blockchain and wallet data. Choose a location with enough free space, "
"as the blockchain can reach 10GB+ in size. It is recommended to use the "
"default data folder if possible."
