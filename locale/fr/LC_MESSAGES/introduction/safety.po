"If you are new to cryptocurrencies, the most important change to understand "
"in comparison with the traditional banking system is that transactions occur"
" **directly between two parties without any central authority** to "
"facilitate the transaction. This also means that **you are responsible for "
"your own security** - there is no bank or credit card company to reverse a "
"transaction if your funds are stolen or lost. If you forget or lose your "
"wallet file, recovery phrase or PIN, you will permanently and irrevocably "
"lose access to your funds."

"SmartCash is a project born out of the desire to create an easy to use, "
"fast, and secure cryptocurrency that can support everyday use such as "
"business payments and daily transactions. In this sense, it is similar to "
"cash or gold, but cryptocurrency can be spent locally and internationally "
"with equal ease, if you are confident you are sending funds to the right "
"destination. For these reasons, the SmartCash documentation has a strong "
"focus on safety and understanding the concepts and features that drive the "
"SmartCash ecosystem."
