"Translations of all SmartCash products are managed courtesy of Transifex, "
"which offers its own detailed documentation of all functions and features. "
"Within Transifex, SmartCash maintains an organization which contains "
"multiple projects and one team of translators assigned to all of the "
"projects. Each project is assigned with one or more target languages for "
"translation by the project maintainer. When a translator joins the team, "
"they are able to choose the languages they feel able to translate. They can "
"then work on any projects specifying this language as a target language."

"In general, languages with minimal regional variation are to be translated "
"into the common language (rather than regional) target. Portuguese, for "
"example, is simply translated into the ``pt`` target language, rather than "
"two separate target languages ``pt_BR`` and ``pt_PT``, for Portuguese as "
"spoken in Brazil and Portugal, respectively. As SmartCash grows, these "
"languages may be separated out into their regional variants by proofreaders,"
" depending on demand. Exceptions to this rule apply where the same spoken "
"language is written differently, such as ``zh_CN`` and ``zh_TW`` for "
"Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese."

"Keeping translations consistent over time as multiple translators work on "
"each target language is a very important part of delivering a quality user "
"experience. For this reason, if you come across any SmartCash-specific "
"terminology such as `smartnodes`, you should use the **Concordance** search "
"function to see how the term has been translated in the past. Transifex will"
" also provide **Suggestions** and **History** if it recognizes a similar "
"string in the database of past translations. Stay consistent with past "
"language use, but also ensure your terminology is up to date with current "
"use!"
