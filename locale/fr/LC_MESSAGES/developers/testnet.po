"With the release of SmartCash NodeClient 1.2.6, SmartCash added support for "
"a great new feature — **named devnets**. Devnets are developer networks that"
" combine some aspects of testnet (the global and public testing network) and"

"network operations using identical versions of the software before they are "
"carried out on the mainnet. There are a few other key differences:"
