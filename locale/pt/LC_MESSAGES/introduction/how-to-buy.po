":ref:`Exchanges <exchanges>` are one of the most popular ways to trade "
"cryptocurrency. A wide range of exchanges exist, each offering slightly "
"different features. Some serve different markets, some are in direct "
"competition, some have cheaper fees, and some are subject to more or less "
"strict regulatory requirements. Most exchanges are centralized, meaning they"
" are operated by a single company, which may be obliged by the laws of the "
"jurisdiction in which it operates to collect data on its customers. Others "
"are decentralized, but as a result have higher escrow requirements since you"
" are dealing peer-to-peer instead of with a trusted entity. Exchanges can be"
" broadly broken down into two categories: exchanges which accept national "
"currency (fiat money) and exchanges which deal in cryptocurrencies only. For"
" safety, exchanges should not be used as wallets. Exchanges are for trading,"
" not for savings."

":ref:`Instant exchanges <instant_exchanges>` perform a similar function to "
"normal exchanges, but without the requirement to log in. They effectively "
"convert one currency to another, with some limits on the amount to be "
"exchanged and usually at a less advantageous rate. Others may even offer to "
"sell cryptocurrency as a credit card purchase."

":ref:`Over the counter <over-the-counter>` exchanges have recently appeared "
"to facilitate sale of SmartCash directly from a company to the individual at"
" a specified price, or peer-to-peer between individuals at a negotiated "
"price. Volume may be limited compared to exchanges, but these services are "
"usually much easier to use. More advanced peer-to-peer sites offer escrow "
"services for a fee to prevent cheating during the sale between two parties "
"who have never met."

"Cryptocurrency exchanges exist to convert national currency, also known as "
"fiat money, into cryptocurrency. Many exchanges do not accept fiat money, "
"and exchange between various cryptocurrencies only. Trades are handled on "
"markets, and trades are created between pairs of currencies, identified by "
"their ticker codes. SmartCash is widely accepted on exchanges and many pairs"
" exist against both fiat money and cryptocurrency. This means it is possible"
" to exchange EUR for SMART, or SMART for BTC, for example. The volume traded"
" on an exchange provides a good indication of how quickly a buy or sell "
"order you place will be filled. This section introduces some of the most "
"popular exchanges for trading SMART."
