"The SmartCard is a way to hold SMART on a physical card. You don’t need a"
" phone to hold your SMART. If you have ever had a problem with using a "
"phone inside a building you will get why this is ideal. Only the merchant"
" needs the internet connection. As simple to use as a credit or debit "
"card but not controlled by any 3rd party processor. And not a preloaded "
"card using a visa fiat system…this is real crypto to crypto."
