"If you are new to cryptocurrencies, the most important change to "
"understand is that transactions occur directly between two parties "
"without any central authority to facilitate the transaction. This also "
"means that you are responsible for your own security - there is no bank "
"or credit card company to reverse a transaction if your funds are stolen "
"or lost. In this sense, it is similar to cash or gold, but cryptocurrency"
" can be spent locally and internationally with equal ease, if you are "
"confident you are sending funds to the right destination. For these "
"reasons, the SmartCash documentation has a strong focus on safety and "
