"As many already know, block rewards are paid to smartnode operators in "
"exchange for validating transactions on the SmartCash network. The IRS has "
"stated unequivocally that “when a taxpayer successfully ‘mines’ virtual "
"currency, the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of "
"receipt is includible in gross income.” To be sure, smartnode do not “mine”,"
" but the IRS considers using computer resources to validate Bitcoin "
"transactions and maintain the public Bitcoin transaction ledger to "
"constitute “mining”. By analogy, a smartnode operator should also treat as "
"regular income the fair market value of the block reward."

"A SmartCash user may demonstrate to the network his or her control over "
"10,000 SMART in order to run a smartnode. These tokens never leave the "
"user’s control. If at any point during the user’s tenure as a smartnode "
"operator, the user disposes of any or all of the 10,000 SMART, the network "
"automatically strips the user of his or her status as a smartnode. Under the"
" US Internal Revenue Code, gain or loss is realized only on the “sale or "
"exchange” of property. The term “sale” generally means the transfer of all "
"right, title, and interest in the property transferred. A number of factors "
"typically are considered to determine whether a sale has occurred, the most "
"important being whether the benefits and burdens of ownership of the "
"transferred property have passed from the transferor to the transferee. In "
"SmartCash, the smartnode operator retains control of the 10,000 SMART and "
"simply demonstrates that control to the network. Therefore, the holding of "
"the 10,000 SMART for purposes of qualifying as a smartnode operator should "
"not cause a taxable event to occur because the user has not transferred any "
"of the benefits and burdens of ownership."

"Assuming that the 10,000 SMART are sold, whether that SmartCash is a "
"“capital asset” will determine the tax treatment of the sale. Stocks, bonds "
"and other investment property for example, are generally treated as capital "
"assets. Inventory, depreciable property, and stock in trade, though, are "
"not. Assuming the smartnode operator held the 10,000 SMART either for "
"investment purposes or for purposes of qualifying as a smartnode operator, "
"the IRS would likely treat gain or loss on the sale of those SmartCash "
"tokens as capital in nature. Therefore, SmartCash held for a long enough "
"period of time could be subject to the lower “long term capital gains” tax "
"rate."

"As with cash or any other currency system, users may use SmartCash in "
"connection with illegal activity. A common question we receive is whether "
"smartnode operators can also be liable for criminal activity, simply by "
"relaying transactions related to that activity. The fundamental legal "
"requirement of *mens rea* makes criminal liability unlikely for smartnode "
"operators."

msgid ""
"Almost all crimes require that a defendant have a defined *mens rea* at the "
"time of an offense. *Mens rea* is a mental state like purposefulness, "
"knowledge, recklessness or negligence. For example, to act with “purpose” is"
" commonly understood as desiring as your “conscious object” the result of a "
"crime. “Knowledge” is a less culpable mindset than “purpose” – acting with "
"“knowledge” requires general awareness that your actions will bring about a "
"particular crime. “Recklessness” requires disregard of a substantial risk. "
"Finally, a person acts “negligently” if they should have been aware of a "
"substantial and unjustifiable risk of a particular consequence of their "
"actions, but were not."

"Most smartnodes have no awareness, while relaying SmartCash transactions, of"
" the identity of the users involved, the ultimate destination of users’ "
"funds, or any other circumstances of SmartCash transactions. As such, it "

" who facilitated an illegal transaction merely by relaying the transaction "
"would have a culpable *mens rea*."

msgstr ""

#: ../../legal.rst:101
msgid ""
"Even if someone is not the principal actor in the commission of a crime, "
"that person can be secondarily liable for their involvement in it. As such, "
"we are sometimes asked whether smartnode operators, by their involvement in "
"relaying SmartCash transactions, could be “aiding and abetting” or "
"“conspiring” to commit a crime that might involve SmartCash. Generally "
"speaking, aiding and abetting requires that the defendant (i) seek by his "
"action to make the crime succeed and (ii) act with the same *mens rea* as "
"required for the principal offense."
msgstr ""

#: ../../legal.rst:110
msgid ""
"No matter the requisite *mens rea* of a particular principal offense "
"committed by a SmartCash user, it is unlikely that a mere smartnode "
"operator, without more, could be found to have “aided and abetted.\" To be "
"sure, the smartnodes do provide assistance in the principal offense – in "
"that smartnode action is required to process all SmartCash transactions. "
"However, the smartnodes would not have the requisite *mens rea* to satisfy "
"the requirements of aiding and abetting liability. smartnode operators have "
"no readily available information about the purpose or consequences of users’"
" SmartCash transactions, or even the originating identity of the sender of "
"funds. As such, so long as a sufficient diversity of non-criminal "
"transactions occur on the SmartCash network, they would not harbor even the "
"least culpable *mens rea* (i.e. negligence) with respect to a user relaying "
"or receiving SmartCash in furtherance of a particular crime."

"“Conspiracy” liability is even less likely. Conspiracy generally requires i)"
" an agreement to commit a crime, ii) knowledge of the unlawful purpose of "
"the agreement, iii) intent to further the unlawful purpose, and iv) an act "

" smartnode operators."

"The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) is the law that primarily governs exchanges in "

"SmartCash transactions. Indeed, the BSA take a flexible, risk- based "
"approach to regulation and contemplate that financial institutions will "
"enter into lines of business with new risks. This risk-based approach "
"requires, at the outset, an independent risk assessment. By and large, the "
"risks faced by exchanges who begin to support SmartCash will be similar to "
"the risks associated with other virtual currencies. - Exchanges should "
