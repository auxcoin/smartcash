"Mining in the context of cryptocurrency such as smartcash refers to the "
"process of searching for solutions to cryptographically difficult problems "
"as a method of securing blocks on the blockchain. The process of mining "
"creates new currency tokens as a reward to the miner. Mining is possible on "
"a range of hardware. smartcash implements an algorithm known as :ref:`keccak"
" <keccak-hash-algorithm>`, which the miner must solve in order to earn "
"rewards."

"The simplest and most general hardware available for mining is the general "
"purpose CPU present in every computer. A CPU is designed to be versatile but"
" offers less efficiency than a GPU, which is designed to rapidly calculate "
"millions of vectors in parallel. While specific CPU instruction enhancements"
" related to cryptography such as AES or AVX can provide a decent boost, GPUs"
" offer a significant performance increase due to their multiple pipelines "
"capable of processing the predictably repetitive calculations associated "
"with cryptocurrency mining. Finally, ASICs are relatively inflexible and can"
" only process the specific function(s) for which they were designed, but at "
"an even faster rate than the more general purpose GPUs and CPUs. The result "
"is a currency which is more secure against brute force attacks on the "
"smartcash blockchain."

"smartcash, like Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies, is based on a "
"decentralized ledger of all transactions, known as a blockchain. This "
"blockchain is secured through a consensus mechanism; in the case of both "
"smartcash and Bitcoin, the consensus mechanism is Proof of Work (PoW). "
"Miners attempt to solve difficult problems with specialized computers, and "
"when they solve the problem, they receive the right to add a new block to "
"the blockchain. If all the other people running the software agree that the "
"problem was solved correctly, the block is added to the blockchain and the "
"miner is rewarded."

"smartcash works a little differently from Bitcoin, however, because it has a"
" two-tier network. The second tier is powered by :ref:`smartnodes "
"<smartnodes>` (Full Nodes), which enable instant transactions (InstantPay). "
"Because this second tier is so important, smartnodes are also rewarded when "
"miners discover new blocks."
msgstr ""

#: ../../mining/index.rst:58
msgid ""
"The smartnode system is referred to as Proof of Service (PoSe), since the "
"smartnodes provide crucial services to the network. In fact, the entire "
"network is overseen by the smartnodes, which have the power to reject "
"improperly formed blocks from miners. If a miner tried to take the entire "
"block reward for themselves or tried to run an old version of the smartcash "
"software, the smartnode network would orphan that block, and it would not be"
" added to the blockchain."

msgid ""
"In short, miners power the first tier, which is the basic sending and "
"receiving of funds and prevention of doublespending. smartnodes power the "
"second tier, which provide the added features that make smartcash different "
"from other cryptocurrencies. smartnodes do not mine, and mining computers "
"cannot serve as smartnodes. Additionally, each smartnode is “secured” by "
"10000 smartcash. Those smartcash remain under the sole control of their "
"owner at all times, and can still be freely spent. The funds are not locked "
"in any way. However, if the funds are moved or spent, the associated "
"smartnode will go offline and stop receiving rewards."
