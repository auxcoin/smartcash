"SmartCash wallets is extremely strong by design, and a well-chosen password "
"should defeat most brute force cracking attempts. If you can recall some "
"details of the password, particularly its length or sequences of characters "
"that may be included, then brute force password cracking techniques may be "
"worth attempting. Several services exist to do this, or you can attempt it "
"yourself. Because SmartCash NodeClient is based on Bitcoin Core, most "
"approaches to apply brute force to crack a Bitcoin wallet will also work for"
" SmartCash wallets."
