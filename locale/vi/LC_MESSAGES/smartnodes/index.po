"This documentation focuses on understanding the services smartnodes provide "
"to the network, but also includes guides on how to run a smartnode, using "
"either a hosting provider or by setting up and maintaining your own hosting "
"solution. The primary requirement to run a smartnode on the SmartCash "
"network is 10000 SMART. This is known as the collateral, and cannot be spent"
" without interrupting operation of the smartnode. The second requirement is "
"the actual server running the SmartCash smartnode software."

"Since operating your own server requires a certain level knowledge of "
"blockchains and Linux server operating systems, several community members "
"offer dedicated hosting solutions for a fee. Taking advantage of these "
"services means the user only needs to provide the smartnode collateral and "
"pay the hosting fee in order to receive payment from the block reward. See "
":ref:`these pages <smartnode-hosting>` for information on how to set up a "
"hosted smartnode."

"Users with a deeper understanding (or curiosity) about the inner workings of"
" the SmartCash network may choose to operate their own smartnode on their "
"own host server. Several steps are required, and the user must assume "
"responsibility for setting up, securing and maintaining both the server and "
"collateral. See these pages for information on how to set up a self-operated"
" smartnode."
