"Simply put, a smartnode is a server with a full copy of the SmartCash "
"blockchain, which guarantees a certain minimum level of performance and "
"functionality to perform certain tasks related to block validation, as well "
"as InstantPay, as the anonymity and instant transaction features in "
"SmartCash are called. The smartnodes are paid for this service, using a "
"concept known as Proof of Service. This is in addition to the Proof of Work "
"done by miners to secure the blockchain."

"Anyone can run a smartnode. The objective is to have enough decentralization"
" to ensure that no single person controls a significant fraction of the "
"smartnodes. However, to avoid bloating the network with unnecessary "
"smartnodes or encouraging reckless operators, there is one condition that "
"needs to be fulfilled: proof of ownership of 100000 SmartCash. The coins "
"don't need to be in the smartnode, but they need to be kept in a certain way"
" that is transparent to the entire network. If the owner moves or spends "
"those coins, the smartnode stops working and payment ceases."

"Smartnodes are paid by the network for the Smartreward, InstantPay they "
"provide. 10% of the block reward is paid out to the smartnodes. As more "
"smartnodes are created, the duration between payments increases. If the "
"collateral behind a smartnode is spent, or if a smartnode stops providing "
"services to the network for more than one hour, it is removed from the list "
"until normal service resumes. In this way, smartnodes are given incentive to"
" provide efficient and reliable services to the network."

"Having so many servers holding a full copy of the blockchain and working for"
" the coin can be extremely useful. Thanks to the reward system, there is no "
"risk of not having enough smartnodes, and the developers can rely on them "
"quickly deploying any new decentralized feature they want to implement. This"
" is where the true strength of SmartCash lies - an incentivized system of "
"thousands of distributed servers working 24x7 means that SmartCash can scale"
" more efficiently and deploy services more quickly than a blockchain run "
"entirely by unpaid volunteers. The more smartnodes, the better and safer the"
" SmartCash network."

"SmartCash, like Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies, is based on a "
"decentralized ledger of all transactions, known as a blockchain. This "
"blockchain is secured through a consensus mechanism; in the case of both "
"SmartCash and Bitcoin, the consensus mechanism is Proof of Work (PoW). "
":ref:`Miners <mining>` attempt to solve difficult problems with specialized "
"computers, and when they solve the problem, they receive the right to add a "
"new block to the blockchain. If all the other people running the software "
"agree that the problem was solved correctly, the block is added to the "
"blockchain and the miner is rewarded."

"SmartCash works a little differently from Bitcoin, however, because it has a"
" two-tier network. The second tier is powered by smartnodes (Full Nodes), "
"which enable instant transactions (InstantPay). Because this second tier is "
"so important, smartnodes are also rewarded when miners discover new blocks."
msgstr ""

#: ../../smartnodes/understanding.rst:86
msgid ""
"The smartnode system is referred to as Proof of Service (PoSe), since the "
"smartnodes provide crucial services to the network. In fact, the entire "
"network is overseen by the smartnodes, which have the power to reject "
"improperly formed blocks from miners. If a miner tried to take the entire "
"block reward for themselves or tried to run an old version of the SmartCash "
"software, the smartnode network would orphan that block, and it would not be"
" added to the blockchain."

"In short, miners power the first tier, which is the basic sending and "
"receiving of funds and prevention of doublespending. Smartnodes power the "
"second tier, which provide the added features that make SmartCash different "
"from other cryptocurrencies. Smartnodes do not mine, and mining computers "
"cannot serve as smartnodes. Additionally, each smartnode is “secured” by "
"100000 SMART. Those SMART remain under the sole control of their owner at "
"all times, and can still be freely spent. The funds are not locked in any "
"way. However, if the funds are moved or spent, the associated smartnode will"
" go offline and stop receiving rewards."
