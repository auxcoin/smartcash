"We believe ‘Core’ teams are a bad idea and something that ultimately "

"In order to create and maintain a decentralized governance structure, we "
"are introducing two concepts SmartHive and Hive Structuring Teams (HST). "
"SmartHive enables anyone that holds coins to vote on proposals submitted "
"by the community. SmartHive will be the lifeblood of the project, which "
"will allow anyone to get involved and submit proposals, helping to "
"generate organic growth at a grassroots level, creating a bottom-up "
"management structure."

"The Hive Structuring Teams (HST) will lay the groundwork for the project "
"and set the framework for the project’s evolution. Initially, the Hive "
"Structuring Teams will operate three separate departments in charge of "
"vital project areas, such as development, outreach and support. Each of "
"these three departments will end up employing people. As teams grow "
"larger, bigger than eight members, more teams will be created, each with "
"its own budget and team coordinator, operating autonomously without a "
"central command and control structure in place."

"The Hive Structuring Teams will consist of people directly involved in "
"the project on a day to day basis, while the overall SmartHive will aim "
"to enrol and engage community members and other 3rd parties interested in"
" growing SmartCash into a global worldwide currency."
