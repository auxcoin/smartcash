"Whenever you are storing objects with a market value, security is "

"As they currently stand, both traditional cards and crypto payment "
"solutions leave a lot to be desired. Transaction fees of over 3% for some"
" cards can add up to substantial losses over time for businesses of all "
"sizes. For even small businesses, it’s normal for more than $50,000 a "
"year to be lost in processing fees."
msgstr ""

#: ../../wallets/index.rst:145
msgid ""
"In addition to this, both buyers and sellers must have access to major "
"banks and their services in order to facilitate these types of "
"transactions; a major problem in many parts of the world. Also, "
"traditional services inherently have long confirmation times of up to "
"several days, which can themselves lead to other issues. Cryptocurrencies"
" have indeed proposed solutions to many of these challenges, as it is "
"easy to find many projects today that offer instant transactions and "
"virtually no fees. But, this doesn’t change the fact that using this new "
"technology in its current form is like trying to send an email in the 80s"

"Using their new feature called the SmartCard, the developers of SmartCash"
" are looking to improve upon and/or eliminate entirely the present "
"limitations of payment cards. SmartCard is the crypto alternative to the "
"debit card which uses the SmartCash blockchain to easily initiate and "
"verify transactions of any size and frequency. As with many other "
"cryptocurrencies, the fees are right around 0%; it costs just fractions "
"of a cent to process a transaction, regardless of the amount. The "
"payments will be instantly confirmed at the time of purchase, meaning "
"there is no delay between authorization of the payment and the transfer "
"of the actual funds."
msgstr ""

#: ../../wallets/index.rst:149
msgid ""
"In a way, the purchases made with SmartCard combine the best of cash, "
"card, and crypto payments. The funds are moved between parties instantly,"
" like cash, but the transaction is authorized by the buyer with a simple "
"code that can be either digitally stored on a smartphone or printed and "
"carried separately as a physical QR code. This makes the payment process "
"just as convenient as regular card payments, and far easier than having "
"to send cryptocurrency manually from a mobile app."

#: ../../wallets/index.rst:154
msgid ""
"There are just two main applications: the card app for the consumer and "
"the Point of Sale (PoS) app for the merchant."
msgstr ""

#: ../../wallets/index.rst:156
msgid ""
"The card app allows anyone to create a SmartCard with just a few taps. "
"Each card has an associated public address which can be used to load more"
" funds onto the card from any wallet or exchange that offers SmartCash. "
"Also included into each one is a QR code which can be scanned by the PoS "
"application from either a phone screen or from a simple piece of paper. "
"Once loaded through this address, the card works very similar to a pre-"
"paid debit card."
msgstr ""

#: ../../wallets/index.rst:158
msgid ""
"The PoS app is equally responsible for this convenience. The merchant "
"only has to specify the transaction amount in the local currency, and the"
" app automatically initiates a transaction in the equivalent amount of "
"SmartCash. The merchant uses the app to scan the code and requests the "
"buyer to enter a confirmation pin. After entering it on the merchant’s "
"smartphone, the app connects to the blockchain to submit the transaction."
" If the code and pin match, and there are enough funds in the card "
"address, the transaction is instantly verified and recorded on the "
"blockchain. The process of scanning a card and entering a pin to confirm "
"is already well familiar to current debit card users, and so it would be "
"easy for everyone to get used to."

msgid "A REVOLUTIONARY PAYMENT SYSTEM EVERYONE CAN LOVE"
msgstr ""

#: ../../wallets/index.rst:163
msgid ""
"This ease of use and familiarity present the key advantage of this system"
" over other crypto payments, which require both parties to be online for "
"a transaction. Once the card is created and loaded, only the merchant is "
"responsible for having a live connection to the internet and the consumer"
" can take the funds anywhere without worrying about a dead battery or "
"lack of signal in remote areas. No need for fumbling with mobile wallet "
"apps, nor any memorization beyond the simple numerical pin just like the "
"ones used for debit purchases. In addition to this, it also offers the "
"advantage of being usable in places where traditional banking services "
"are only partially available, or even absent entirely. Whereas other "
"mobile payment solutions require bank accounts for both parties to "
"send/receive the funds, this one uses the SmartCash blockchain instead "
"and is thus accessible to anyone who wishes to use it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../wallets/index.rst:165
msgid ""
"Naturally, these benefits would also be quite attractive to buyers and "
"sellers in more developed nations as well. Other crypto solutions fall "
"somewhat short of their promises. Crypto debit cards suffer from the same"
" fees and transaction delays as any other current plastic card, and "
"sending money through current mobile wallets requires a lot of time and "
"effort to make the payments. Compared to these options, SmartCard "
"payments are in a league of their own in convenience and speed. Add to "
"this the fact that the SmartCash community is actively seeking, "
"recruiting, and sponsoring business owners and entrepreneurs globally, "
"and it is easy to imagine how the SmartCard could increasingly gain "
"global adoption across a wide range of markets and economies."
