"The SmartCard is a way to hold SMART on a physical card. You don’t need a"
" phone to hold your SMART. If you have ever had a problem with using a "
"phone inside a building you will get why this is ideal. Only the merchant"
" needs the internet connection. As simple to use as a credit or debit "
"card but not controlled by any 3rd party processor. And not a preloaded "
"card using a visa fiat system…this is real crypto to crypto."

"Breaking QR if stolen: We use BIP38 encryption that is executed in each "

"Private key then is encrypted with AES256 with decryptionKey hash and "
"random bytes. So even if one QR Key is \"cracked\", all other Encrypted "
"Keys are safe because random bytes and decryption key (GUID) are unique "
"and almost impossible to duplicate. Each QR decryption takes about 1 "
"second in modern CPU, David calculated how many years would take if we "
"could do 1000 hashes per second. ((32^16) / 100 000 000) * seconds = 383 "

"SmartPay Tempering: first you should do business with whom you trust and "

"a secret authorization which only the official application build has. "
"That's why Card Name verification allows to guarantee Card API "
