"SmartCash Electrum gathers configuration data when run for the first time. "
"For more on the concepts behind this process, skip to the later sections of "
"this guide discussing backups, security, and addresses. When setting up "
"SmartCash Electrum for the first time, a wizard will guide you through the "
"process of creating your first wallet. The first screen asks how you would "
"like to connect to the remote server. Select **Auto connect** and click "
"**Next** to continue. You will see a notice that no wallet currently exists."
" Enter a name for your wallet (or accept the default name) and click "

"store/recover the seed. If stored safely, a seed can be used to restore a "
"lost wallet on another computer. Choose between **Create a new seed**, **I "
"already have a seed**, or **Use a hardware device**. If you are using "
"Electrum SmartCash for the first time and not restoring an existing wallet, "
