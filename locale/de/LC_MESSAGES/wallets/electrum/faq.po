msgid "How does SmartCash Electrum work?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../wallets/electrum/faq.rst:14
msgid ""
"SmartCash Electrum focuses on speed, low resource usage and providing a "
"simple user experience for SmartCash. Startup times are instant because it "
"operates in conjunction with high-performance servers that handle the most "
"complicated parts of the SmartCash system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../wallets/electrum/faq.rst:20
msgid "Does SmartCash Electrum trust servers?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../wallets/electrum/faq.rst:22
msgid ""
"Not really; the SmartCash Electrum client never sends private keys to the "
"servers. In addition, it verifies the information reported by servers using "
"a technique called `Simple Payment Verification "
"<http://docs.electrum.org/en/latest/spv.html>`_."

msgid "What is the Seed?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../wallets/electrum/faq.rst:30
msgid ""
"The seed is a random phrase that is used to generate your private keys. "
"Example::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../wallets/electrum/faq.rst:35
msgid ""
"Your wallet can be entirely recovered from its seed. To do this, select the "
"**I already have a seed** option during startup."
msgstr ""

#: ../../wallets/electrum/faq.rst:39
msgid "How secure is the seed?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../wallets/electrum/faq.rst:41
msgid ""
"The seed created by SmartCash Electrum has 128 bits of entropy. This means "
"that it provides the same level of security as a SmartCash private key (of "
"length 256 bits). Indeed, an elliptic curve key of length n provides n/2 "
"bits of security."

msgid "What are change addresses?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../wallets/electrum/faq.rst:49
msgid ""
"The SmartCash Electrum wallet design and workflow are based on a concept "
"called a “wallet generation seed”. This seed is a unique, randomly- selected"
" list of twelve words. A SmartCash Electrum wallet uses its seed as a "
"template for generating addresses."
msgstr ""

"**Receive** tab. Next, open the collapsible entry marked **Change**."

"Notice that the total balance does not only show the sum of all receiving "
"addresses, but also the separately listed **Change** addresses. Where did "
"these new change addresses come from and why does the first one now hold "
"funds?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../wallets/electrum/faq.rst:67
msgid ""
"SmartCash is an electronic cash system, meaning that it shares much in "
"common with the process of using paper banknotes. Although some cash "
"payments involve exact change, many do not. You tend to “overpay” when using"
" cash, and expect to receive the difference as change. Perhaps surprisingly,"
" this is how SmartCash transactions work as well. If the entire balance of "
"an address is not required for any given transaction, the remainder is sent "
"to a new and unused address under control of the same wallet. This address "
"is generated deterministically (rather than randomly) from the wallet seed, "
"which means that any other wallet will also regenerate the change addresses "
"in the same order from the same recovery seed, and have access to the "
"balances."
msgstr ""

#: ../../wallets/electrum/faq.rst:79
msgid ""
"Spending the entire balance and sending any remainder to a change address is"
" considered good practice because it prevents the transaction recipient from"
" linking transactions by browsing the blockchain, thus compromising your "
"privacy. If privacy is not a concern, change addresses can be disabled via "
"the **Tools > preferences** menu option."

"Your seed and private keys are encrypted using AES-256-CBC. The private keys"
