"The SmartCash community is one of the network's strongest features, and "
"newcomers are always welcome. However, because of the way proposals work,"
" there needs to be reasonable trust that the work promised in the "
"proposal will be completed if it passes. If you are new, consider "
"starting with a smaller proposal first to prove your ability to deliver "
"on time and budget. Attaching your real name or `Keybase "
"<https://keybase.io>`_ identity to a proposal also helps build trust. If "
"you are a making a large proposal, get a team together and nominate (or "
"hire) one person to serve as community liaison, since posting from "
"multiple accounts can be confusing."
