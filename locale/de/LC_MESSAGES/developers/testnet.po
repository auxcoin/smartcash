#~ "With the release of SmartCash NodeClient"
#~ " 1.2.6, SmartCash added support for a"
#~ " great new feature — **named devnets**. "
#~ "Devnets are developer networks that "
#~ "combine some aspects of testnet (the "
#~ "global and public testing network) and"
#~ " some aspects of regtest (the "
#~ "local-only regression testing mode that "
#~ "provides controlled block generation). Unlike"
#~ " testnet, multiple independent devnets can"
#~ " be created and coexist without "
#~ "interference."
