":ref:`Exchanges <exchanges>` are one of the most popular ways to trade "
"cryptocurrency. A wide range of exchanges exist, each offering slightly "
"different features. Some serve different markets, some are in direct "
"competition, some have cheaper fees, and some are subject to more or less"
" strict regulatory requirements. Most exchanges are centralized, meaning "
"they are operated by a single company, which may be obliged by the laws "
"of the jurisdiction in which it operates to collect data on its "
"customers. Others are decentralized, but as a result have higher escrow "
"requirements since you are dealing peer-to-peer instead of with a trusted"
" entity. Exchanges can be broadly broken down into two categories: "
"exchanges which accept national currency (fiat money) and exchanges which"
" deal in cryptocurrencies only. For safety, exchanges should not be used "
"as wallets. Exchanges are for trading, not for savings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction/how-to-buy.rst:29
msgid ""
":ref:`Instant exchanges <instant_exchanges>` perform a similar function "
"to normal exchanges, but without the requirement to log in. They "
"effectively convert one currency to another, with some limits on the "
"amount to be exchanged and usually at a less advantageous rate. Others "
"may even offer to sell cryptocurrency as a credit card purchase."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction/how-to-buy.rst:36
msgid ""
":ref:`Over the counter <over-the-counter>` exchanges have recently "
"appeared to facilitate sale of SmartCash directly from a company to the "
"individual at a specified price, or peer-to-peer between individuals at a"
" negotiated price. Volume may be limited compared to exchanges, but these"
" services are usually much easier to use. More advanced peer-to-peer "
"sites offer escrow services for a fee to prevent cheating during the sale"
" between two parties who have never met."

":ref:`ATMs <atms>` accepting card and cash payments in return for crypto "
"are widely available. Mapping services can show the specific location of "
"these machines, or you can even set one up at your own business and earn "

"Cryptocurrency exchanges exist to convert national currency, also known "
"as fiat money, into cryptocurrency. Many exchanges do not accept fiat "
"money, and exchange between various cryptocurrencies only. Trades are "
"handled on markets, and trades are created between pairs of currencies, "
"identified by their ticker codes. SmartCash is widely accepted on "
"exchanges and many pairs exist against both fiat money and "
"cryptocurrency. This means it is possible to exchange EUR for SMART, or "
"SMART for BTC, for example. The volume traded on an exchange provides a "
"good indication of how quickly a buy or sell order you place will be "
"filled. This section introduces some of the most popular exchanges for "
"trading SMART."
