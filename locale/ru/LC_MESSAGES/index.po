"If you are new to cryptocurrencies, the most important change to understand "
"is that transactions occur directly between two parties without any central "
"authority to facilitate the transaction. This also means that you are "
"responsible for your own security - there is no bank or credit card company "
"to reverse a transaction if your funds are stolen or lost. In this sense, it"
" is similar to cash or gold, but cryptocurrency can be spent locally and "
"internationally with equal ease, if you are confident you are sending funds "
"to the right destination. For these reasons, the SmartCash documentation has"
" a strong focus on safety and understanding the concepts and features that "
"drive the SmartCash ecosystem. The videos, links and documentation below can"
" help you get started, or use the table of contents on the left to find a "
"specific topic of interest."
