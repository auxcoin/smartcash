"This documentation describes how to safely back up your wallet file for safe"
" storage in case your computer or laptop is damaged or lost. smartcash Core "
"stores all data necessary to control your smartcash addresses in a single "
"file called *wallet.dat*. This wallet is in the Berkeley DB format and "
"stores the pairs of private/public cryptographic keys used to manage your "
"balances on the smartcash blockchain. SmartCash Node Client makes most of "
"these operations transparent and even generates automatic backups of your "
"wallet file in case it is corrupted, but the user is responsible for "
"ensuring that these backups are stored in a safe place. **If you lose access"
" to your wallet file, you will permanently lose access to your smartcash.**"

"Any backup depends to some extent on the existence of software capable of "

"to store a copy of the software used to create the backup together with the "

"The *wallet.dat* file itself should be encrypted using a password set from "
"the **Settings > Encrypt Wallet** menu item. However, this only prevents "
"someone with access to the file from creating transactions, not from opening"
" the file. You could additionally store the file in another encrypted "

"Finally it is important to understand that *wallet.dat* itself is a "
"relatively dangerous way to store large amounts of funds - it is simply a "
"database file storing private keys. While the convenience of storing a "
"wallet file directly is fine for smaller holdings, it is more secure to to "
"store large amounts of smartcash on a single predefined address in a way "
"that you are guaranteed access through any software supporting the protocol,"
" rather than a specific implementation of that protocol. If you are "
"interested in this, read more about paper wallets, where the private key can"
" be printed directly or also encrypted using BIP38 for safe storage."

"There is no fixed procedure to verify your backup, but you should test "
"restoring it at least once to make sure it works. If you have a simple copy "
"of the file, try to restore it to your current *nodeclient* folder and start"
" SmartCash Node Client to make sure it opens without any errors. If you "
"decided to store the file in an encrypted zip file, make sure you can unzip "
"it and that it opens correctly in SmartCash Node Client. In short, make sure"
" that you (or the person you are trusting to eventually go through this "
"process for you) can actually reverse your backup process to get access to "
"your smartcash, instead of relying on the fact that this process should "
"theoretically be reversible."
