"Developed by Czech startup `SatoshiLabs <https://satoshilabs.com>`_, the "
"$99 device is essentially a USB dongle designed to add an extra "

"By virtue of its design, Trezor can be used to sign transactions on "
"'unsafe' computers and is impervious to keyloggers and many other vectors"
" of attack, so even if your host PC is compromised, the attacker has no "
"way of getting your private key. That's also where the device gets its "
"name, as 'trezor' translates into 'vault' in most Slavic languages, "
"including Czech. A kind of 'vault' for your private bitcoin key, Trezor "
"claims to use a number of clever tricks to maintain security even on "
"compromised and unsafe machines."
