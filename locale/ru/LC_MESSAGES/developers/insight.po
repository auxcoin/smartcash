"The open-source SmartCash Insight REST API provides you with a "
"convenient, powerful and simple way to read data from the SmartCash "
"network and build your own services with it. Simple HTTP endpoints exist "
"for all common operations on the SmartCash blockchain familiar from the "
"Bitcore Insight API, as well as SmartCash-specific features such as "
"InstantSend transactions, budget proposals, sporks and the masternode "
"list. This documentation describes how to set up the `SmartCash Insight "
"API <https://github.com/SmartCash/insight-ui>`__ server and (optionally) "
"the `SmartCash Insight UI <https://github.com/SmartCash/insight-ui>`__ "
"block explorer."
