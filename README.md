# SmartCash Documentation

The official SmartCash documentation is oriented towards the average user and serves to describe all aspects of the SmartCash ecosystem, ranging from information for new users through to guides on more difficult tasks such as compiling SmartCash Core from source. This user documentation is available at https://smartcash.readthedocs.io/, while protocol documentation for developers is available separately at https://hoangton.github.io/smartcash/

This documentation is written in reStructuredText and is designed to be built with Sphinx and hosted by Read the Docs. Pull requests modifying the English source text are welcome in this repository, while contributions to translations of the source text are welcomed on the Transifex platform at https://www.transifex.com/smartcash/smart-docs
