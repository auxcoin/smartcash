Testnet
=======

Testnet is a fully functioning SmartCash blockchain with the one key
exception that because the SmartCash on the network can be created freely, it
has no value. This currency, known as tSmartCash, can be requested from a
faucet to help developers test new versions of SmartCash, as well as test
network operations using identical versions of the software before they
are carried out on the mainnet. There are a few other key differences:

- Testnet operates on port 19678 (instead of 9678)
- Launching SmartCash NodeClient in testnet mode shows an blue splash screen

To start SmartCash NodeClient in testnet mode, find your smartcash.conf file and enter
the following line::

  testnet = 1
